## Was bedeutet Prompt Engineering 04:30

The 101 of AI Communication: Prompts, Context, and Model Intelligence

The Two Pillars of Great AI Communication

- Think of every AI interaction as having two parts: your Prompt and your Context.
    
- **The Prompt:** Your direct question or command. Keep it simple and clear.
    
- **The Context:** The crucial background information that gives your prompt meaning. It tells the AI about your goals, brand, customers, and project specifics.
    
- Modern AIs are powerful thinking partners, but their biggest limitation is a lack of relevant information and context from you.
    

Debunking the Myth of the "Prompt Engineer"

- The idea that you need complex, engineered prompts is a relic of the past, necessary for older, less capable AI models.
    
- Modern models like GPT-4o and Claude 4 Sonnet are designed to understand natural, conversational language.
    
- In fact, creating overly complex prompts is unnecessary in over 95% of all use cases.
    
- Focusing on the "perfect" prompt while ignoring context is the fastest way to get generic, unusable results.

Good vs. Bad: Why Context is Your Leverage

- **The Low-Context Trap:**
    
    - **Your Prompt:** "Write a social media post about our new AI course."
        
    - **The Result:** A generic, boring post that could be for any course, anywhere. The AI is guessing what you want.
        
- **The High-Context Advantage:**
    
    - **Your Context:** You provide a short briefing document with the course description, target audience, and a successful past post as a style example.
        
    - **Your Prompt:** "Using the provided briefing, write 3 engaging LinkedIn posts for our new course."
        
    - **The Result:** A highly relevant, specific, and on-brand post that speaks directly to your audience.

Your Universal Prompt Template

Use this simple structure as a starting point for clear and effective communication:

1. **Role & Goal:** Tell the AI who it should be and what it should achieve.
    
    - _Example:_ "Act as an expert copywriter. Your goal is to create an engaging newsletter."
        
2. **Task:** Give a clear, direct instruction.
    
    - _Example:_ "Write three potential subject lines for the attached draft."
        
3. **Context:** Point to the information you have provided.
    
    - _Example:_ "Use our brand voice guide and the key messages from the project briefing."
        
4. **Format:** Specify how you want the output delivered.
    
    - _Example:_ "Provide the output as a simple, numbered list."

Effective Prompts & the New Reality: Clear, Simple, and Purpose-Driven

Your New Superpower: The Iterative Workflow

- The most effective way to work with an AI is not with one giant prompt, but through a simple, back-and-forth conversation.
    
- Stop trying to write one "perfect" prompt that does everything at once. This is slow and often fails.
    
- **Think of it as a creative dialogue:**
    
    - Start with a clear, simple request.
        
    - Review the AI's output.
        
    - Provide clear, simple feedback to refine it.
        
- This iterative process gives you more control and leads to superior results.
    

Good vs. Bad: The Power of Iteration

- **The Old Way (One Complex Prompt):**
    
    - "Write me a LinkedIn post that's engaging, uses an activating tone, has 3 bullet points about the benefits of my AI course for marketers, is under 150 words, includes 5 relevant hashtags, and has a strong call to action. The tone should be like an expert but approachable..."
        
    - **The likely result:** The AI gets confused, misses an instruction, or produces a generic text.
        
- **The New Way (Iterative Dialogue):**
    
    - **Prompt 1:** "Draft a LinkedIn post about our new AI context course for marketers."
        
    - **Prompt 2:** "Great start. Now make the tone more activating and add 3 bullet points on the key benefits."
        
    - **Prompt 3:** "Perfect. Please add 5 relevant hashtags."

When is Advanced Prompting Still Relevant?

While an iterative approach is your go-to for 95% of tasks, advanced prompting is still powerful for specific, repeatable workflows:

- **Use Case 1: Data Structuring & Extraction**
    
    - When you need to pull specific information from unstructured text and format it perfectly every time (e.g., as JSON or CSV for a database).
        
- **Use Case 2: Automated Workflows & APIs**
    
    - When a prompt is a fixed step in an automated software process and needs to be extremely precise and reliable without human oversight.
        
- **Use Case 3: Complex Role-Playing**
    
    - For deep creative tasks or simulations where an AI must maintain a very specific and complex persona over a long interaction.

Equipping AI Assistants with Knowledge and Personality

## From Generic Tool to Expert Partner

- While a good prompt gives directions, high-quality context provides the map and the destination.
    
- Without context, AI can only provide generic answers.
    
- It is the crucial factor that transforms the AI from a blunt tool into a genuine thinking partner.
    
- By providing specific information, the AI understands not just WHAT you want, but also HOW and WHY you want it.
    
- Using persistent context is the most effective method to dramatically improve AI quality and reduce errors or "hallucinations".

Your Toolkit for Smart Context

- The goal is to create specialized assistants by giving them a permanent knowledge base to draw from.
    
- **For ChatGPT → Use GPTs:** This feature allows you to build custom versions of ChatGPT that combine instructions with additional, permanent context you provide.
    
- **For Claude → Use Projects:** This feature lets you create dedicated project spaces where you can upload key documents for the AI to reference, ensuring context is always available.
    
- **For Quick Personalization → Use Custom Instructions:** A simple but effective feature in ChatGPT to give the model a baseline understanding of who you are and how it should respond in all your chats.
    

---

What to Include in Your Context Briefing

- To build a powerful assistant, start by creating a central briefing document. Here's what it should include:
    
- **Your Company's DNA:** Information about you, your positioning, company data, products, services, and USPs.
    
- **Your Brand Voice & Style:** Define your tonality and provide examples of your best content, like successful LinkedIn posts or newsletters.
    
- **Specific Project Details:** Include information about individual client projects to create highly specialized assistants for each one.
    
- **A Hidden Goldmine:** Use transcripts of your meetings as a rich source of valuable, often overlooked context.

- You know the key tools—GPTs, Claude Projects, and Custom Instructions—to build a smarter AI assistant.
    
- You have a practical checklist to start gathering the most valuable context for your work.
    
- You are ready to stop being a simple user and start becoming a "Context Designer".

## Herausforderungen 03:28

Mastering Challenges and Unleashing Potential

The Single Biggest Barrier to Effective AI

- The greatest challenge for a context-based AI strategy is often the inability to share relevant data.
    
- Many companies have restrictive data policies that forbid uploading internal documents to AI tools.
    
- This creates a vicious cycle: without context, AI results remain mediocre, which reinforces the idea that the tools aren't valuable.
    
- Your key task is to navigate these hurdles to provide your AI with the knowledge it needs to perform.
    

---

Solving the 3 Most Common Context Hurdles

You will face predictable challenges. Here is how to overcome them:

- Challenge 1: The Data Policy Block.
    
    - **Solution:** Anonymize your data. Replace specific client names and numbers with generic placeholders. Focus on providing non-sensitive context like writing style guides, public information, and process descriptions.
        
- Challenge 2: The Outdated Knowledge.
    
    - **Solution:** Make it a habit. Set a recurring weekly task to update your central briefing documents with the latest information, just as you would manage any other project.
        
- Challenge 3: The "Cold Start" Problem.
    
    - **Solution:** Start small and focused. Don't try to build a massive context library at once. Begin with a single, high-value task (e.g., creating a "Mail Responder" assistant) and build the context for that one use case first.

The Rise of a New, Critical Role

- It's time to shift your thinking from crafting commands to curating knowledge.
    
- We are seeing the emergence of the **"Context Designer"**—a new, strategic role for every modern team.
    
- Instead of engineering prompts, the Context Designer builds and maintains the knowledge base the AI uses.
    
- This person strategically understands which information the AI needs to move from a simple tool to a transformative partner.
    

---

What You Can Do Now

- You can now identify the most common challenges in practical context management and apply concrete solutions.
    
- You understand the strategic function of a "Context Designer" and can start applying these principles to your own work.
    
- You are ready to develop "AI Contextuality" as a core professional competency.
    
- **Your next step:** Choose one of your daily workflows and start building a small, dedicated context document for it.
